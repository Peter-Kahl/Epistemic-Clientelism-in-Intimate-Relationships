## Abstract

This paper advances a unified theory of epistemic psychology, proposing that the dynamics of intimacy disclose the moral architecture of human knowing. Building on _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ and the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED), it develops _KMED-R (Relationships)_—a formal and conceptual framework modelling how recognition (ρ), suppression (σ), and fiduciary containment (ϕ) regulate the evolution of three relational state variables: Epistemic Autonomy (EA), Dissonance Tolerance (DT), and Dependence (D).

Integrating longitudinal, developmental, and cross-cultural evidence, KMED-R situates adult relational ethics within a continuum beginning in infancy (KMED-I) and extending through partnership, education, and institutional life.  Studies across family systems, bicultural adaptation, and filial morality demonstrate that early fiduciary asymmetries of care and authority script the later moral grammar of trust, conflict, and recognition.

The paper introduces the _Fiduciary Boundary Test_ (FBT) and the _Trust–Authority–Clientelism Matrix_ (TACM) as diagnostic tools for distinguishing fiduciary openness from clientelist closure in both interpersonal and institutional systems.  Conceptual simulations show that epistemic stability arises not from affective intensity but from fiduciary ethics: systems high in ϕ display resilience, repair, and bounded autonomy, whereas low-ϕ (clientelist) systems collapse into dependency or fragmentation.

By linking developmental psychology, social conflict research, and moral philosophy, the study reframes attachment, cognition, and governance as fiduciary processes—ethical negotiations of interpretive authority.  Dissonance is recast as the engine of epistemic growth; silencing, as its moral corruption.  Knowing itself emerges as a fiduciary act: it begins in trust, is sustained through recognition, and decays under suppression.
