### Abstract

This paper extends Epistemic Clientelism Theory into the domain of intimate relationships, positioning the family as the crucible where autonomy and dependence are forged. While earlier analyses have centred on institutions and academia, I argue that clientelist dynamics equally structure the micro-politics of families and partnerships. In these settings, epistemic autonomy is often surrendered in exchange for love, protection, or belonging, making the stakes more existential than in public life. Drawing on psychological and psychiatric research on conformity, obedience, attachment, and trauma, I show how epistemic submission is cultivated in childhood and enacted in adulthood. Intimacy thus emerges as both a crucible of epistemic pathologies—gaslighting, testimonial injustice, silencing—and a site of resilience, where dissonance can be transformed into agency. To safeguard autonomy, I propose a fiduciary–epistemic framework that reinterprets love as trusteeship, grounded in duties of care, loyalty, and candour. An Intimate Epistemic Oath is introduced as a normative scaffold for restructuring dependence into dignified, pluralistic agency. The conclusion outlines a research agenda spanning developmental psychology, psychiatry, and family law, and argues that intimacy is not only a testing ground for epistemic psychology but also a key site where the conditions of freedom, recognition, and flourishing are either secured or betrayed.
