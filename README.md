## Abstract

This paper introduces the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) — the first formal mathematical model of epistemic clientelism in intimacy. It identifies the mechanisms that underlie social life — recognition, silencing, dissonance, and clientelism — and shows how these are first rehearsed in families and partnerships, where autonomy and dependence are forged.

KMED is specified through equations and implemented in Python, with simulations tracking how repeated micro-dissonance events shape long-term trajectories of epistemic autonomy, dissonance tolerance, and dependence. The results demonstrate how fiduciary scaffolds transform dissonance into resilience, while clientelist suppression corrodes agency and entrenches subordination. By making these dynamics explicit and testable, KMED provides a proof-of-concept for a computational epistemic psychology.

The contribution spans three domains. For **epistemic psychology**, the paper reframes dissonance as an epistemic event that can produce either submission or resilience. For **psychiatry**, it offers a lens on trauma, gaslighting, and attachment, showing how rupture and repair in therapeutic alliances mirror fiduciary safeguarding of agency. For **philosophy and governance**, it extends fiduciary–epistemic theory into private life, reframing love as trusteeship grounded in duties of care, loyalty, candour, and a Razian account of authority as service.

Finally, the paper advances an _Intimate Epistemic Oath_ as a normative scaffold for restructuring dependence into dignified, pluralistic agency. Intimacy thus emerges as the proving ground of epistemic psychology and the first site where the conditions of freedom, recognition, and resilience in social life are secured or betrayed.
