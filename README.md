### Abstract

This paper identifies the epistemic and psychological mechanisms that underlie social life — recognition, silencing, dissonance, and clientelism — and shows how they are first rehearsed in intimacy. Extending Epistemic Clientelism Theory into the domain of intimate relationships, it positions the family as the crucible where autonomy and dependence are forged. While earlier analyses centred on institutions and academia, I argue that clientelist dynamics equally structure the micro-politics of families and partnerships. In these settings, epistemic autonomy is often surrendered in exchange for love, protection, or belonging, making the stakes more existential than in public life.

The contribution lies across three domains. To **epistemic psychology**, the paper introduces intimacy as a proving ground for theories of autonomy, recognition, and dissonance, reinterpreting cognitive dissonance as an epistemic event that can yield either submission or resilience. To **psychiatry**, it offers a complementary lens on trauma, gaslighting, and attachment, showing how rupture and repair in therapeutic alliances mirror fiduciary safeguarding of agency. To **philosophy and governance**, it extends fiduciary–epistemic theory into private life, reframing love as trusteeship grounded in duties of care, loyalty, candour, and a Razian account of authority as service.

The paper advances an _Intimate Epistemic Oath_ as a normative scaffold for restructuring dependence into dignified, pluralistic agency. Intimacy thus emerges as the testing ground of epistemic psychology and the first site where the conditions of freedom, recognition, and resilience in social life are secured or betrayed.
