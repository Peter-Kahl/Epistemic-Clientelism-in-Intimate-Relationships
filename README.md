### Abstract

This paper contributes to epistemic psychology by extending Epistemic Clientelism Theory into the domain of intimate relationships, positioning the family as the crucible where autonomy and dependence are forged. While earlier analyses have centred on institutions and academia, I argue that clientelist dynamics equally structure the micro-politics of families and partnerships. In these settings, epistemic autonomy is often surrendered in exchange for love, protection, or belonging, making the stakes more existential than in public life.

The contribution lies across three domains. To **epistemic psychology**, the paper introduces intimacy as a proving ground for theories of autonomy, recognition, and dissonance, reinterpreting cognitive dissonance as an epistemic event that can produce either submission or resilience. To **psychiatry**, it offers a complementary lens on trauma, gaslighting, and attachment, showing how rupture and repair in therapeutic alliances mirror fiduciary safeguarding of agency. To **philosophy and governance**, it extends fiduciary–epistemic theory into private life, reframing love itself as trusteeship grounded in duties of care, loyalty, and candour.

An _Intimate Epistemic Oath_ is advanced as a normative scaffold for restructuring dependence into dignified, pluralistic agency. The conclusion outlines a research agenda spanning developmental psychology, psychiatry, and family law, and argues that intimacy is not only a testing ground for epistemic psychology but also a key site where the conditions of freedom, recognition, and flourishing are secured or betrayed. Just as authoritarian capture exploits epistemic fragility in public life, so too does clientelism in the household — making the transformation of intimacy a political as well as personal necessity.
